Hello there, I'm Lester! I'm a frontend software engineer based in Singapore. I started this blog as a way for me to share the things I've learnt throughout my software development journey, as well as some of my favourite resources I've seen over the past few years. You can also find me on my [homepage](https://www.lesterong.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com/lesterong).

To get things started, here's some of my favourite blogs (I'll keep this list updated as I discover more resources):

- [web.dev](https://web.dev)
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com)
- [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com)

P.S. If you spot any bugs on this site, you can report it [here](https://github.com/lesterong/nextjs-blog/issues).
